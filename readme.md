#Usage
- Compile, run `$ gcc main.c -o output_file_name`
- Sometimes necessary, make executable: `$ chmod +x output_file_name`
- Run program, `$ ./output_file_name`
- If you want to see the structs (debug mode), run `$ ./output_file_name -d`

#Things to do

- Optimize for better performance, it can be slightly laggy now...
- update the algorithm, marix looks a little different than this
